# tree-sitter-hledger

Inspired by https://github.com/cbarrete/tree-sitter-ledger/, this is a from-scratch development of a tree-sitter grammar for [hledger](https://hledger.org/dev/hledger.html) files.

It is far from feature complete or even ready for use, which is why this readme is very empty for now.
